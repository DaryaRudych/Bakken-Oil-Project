In this project we will look at Eagle Ford Shale Play oil wells, all of which are located in the state of Texas, to investigate potential patterns in Eagle Ford oil production and compare production by operator and sub-play with an ultimate goal of predicting production in later projects of this course.

### Dataset

The dataset we will be using contains basic information on all the wells drilled and being operated in Eagle Ford play and spans from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, the dataset includes information on:
1. Operators (The companies that have drilled the wells and are now producing oil from them)
2. Geographical information (Where is the well located, latitudes, longitudes etc, county, state, sub-play etc.)
3. Important Well Lifecycle dates (permit, drilling, completion, first production etc.)
3. Important well development costs (capex spent in developing the well and getting it ready for production - rig cost, casing cost, water cost, proppant cost etc.)
4. Information on operational parameters (lateral length, proppant used, water used, frac stages etc.)
5. Information on initial production (How many BOE was reported on Day 1, first 30 days, first 60 days first 90 days first 180 days and so on)

### Goals & Approaches

In this project we intend to produce some basic visualizations (matplotlib) and compute descriptive statistics (numpy, pandas) to get the basic features and the summary of the data in the study. We will then focus on answering the following questions:

1. Which operator has the most production? 
2. Which operator has the lowest cost per BOEA? 
3. Which sub-playproduces the most?
4. Who are the dominant operators in each sub-play?
5. Does frac size matter, i.e. does the amount of proppant used increase production?
6. Does amount of capital spent in developing a well have an impact on initial production?



### Key Limitations/Uncertainities

TBD
