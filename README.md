# Project Title: Analysis of Eagle Ford Oil&Gas Production

## Goal Statement
We're a burgeoning exploration company seeking funding for an Eagle Ford Shale asset. Investing in a quality area is our primary concern. We define a quality area as an area that is primarily oil and has high production values. Costs are important and are prohibitive at exorbitant levels. We will perform an analysis of sub-Plays to define areas (sub-plays) of biggest opportunity (think, zip codes for the O&G). Furthermore, sub-plays of high well and operator activity are not only indicative of geologically sound areas, but also have more data on drilling and completion costs   and methods. Once we narrow down to two sub-plays we will look at minimum and maximum potential costs for drilling and completing.

## Data
The dataset we are using has been obtained from an aggregating company Wood Mackenzie. The dataset contains basic information on all the wells drilled and being operated in Eagle Ford play and spans from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, the dataset includes information on:
1. Operators (The companies that have drilled the wells and are now producing oil from them)
2. Geographical information (Where is the well located, latitudes, longitudes etc, county, state, sub-play etc.)
3. Important Well Lifecycle dates (permit, drilling, completion, first production etc.)
3. Important well development costs (capex spent in developing the well and getting it ready for production - rig cost, casing cost, water cost, proppant cost etc.)
4. Information on operational parameters (lateral length, proppant used, water used, fracking stages etc.)
5. Information on initial production (How many BOE was reported on Day 1, first 30 days, first 60 days first 90 days first 180 days and so on.

## Project Objectives Breakdown:
1.	Determine areas with oil as a primary commodity
2.	Identify sub-plays with highest activity (operators, well count)
3.	Identify most profitable sub-plays (i.e. High Total Production (EUR (boe)
4.	Compare sub-plays by Average Drilling Costs and Average Completions Costs
5.	Once top two sub-plays are established, analyze competitor data to get potential minimum and maximum drilling and completion costs.

## Analysis Outline:

## STEP 1: DATA CLEANING 

*** Paste code of dropping null values

## STEP 2: VISUALIZING THE GEOGRAPHIC & TEMPORAL EXTENT OF THE DATA

**Takeaways from visualizations:**
- most of wells in Eagle Ford produce oil
- Black Oil and Karnes Trough are largest sub-plays in Eagle Ford Play
- The production of oil&gas peaked by 2015. In October 2015 the price of crude oil has dropped significantly resulting in the major short-term drop in investment and downward trend in production reflected by the graph. The industry has recovered in 2017. However, the incomplete data for 2017 does not allow us to see whether the production has actually returned to the levels of 2015.
